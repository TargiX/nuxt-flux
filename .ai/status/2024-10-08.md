Session Update: 2023-04-15
Development Steps
/store/tagStore.ts: Updated tag store logic
Removed size-related logic from tag toggling
Simplified tag and secondary tag toggling functions
/components/ForceGraph.vue: Refactored force graph component
Implemented consistent sizing logic for primary and secondary tags
Added stems (links) connecting first-level circles with second-level ones
Updated node appearance function to handle size changes
/components/TagCloud.vue: Updated tag cloud component
Added handler for secondary tag selection
Updated computed property for generated prompt to include secondary tags
Key Decisions
Moved size-related logic from the store to the ForceGraph component to improve separation of concerns
Implemented a consistent 20% size increase for both primary and secondary tags when selected
Added visual connections (stems) between primary and secondary tags to improve user understanding of relationships
Next Steps
1. Rework force graphs levels to work differently, initially user will only be able to select primary tags, and then secondary tags will pop up on the click of a primary tag when its become selected. This will allow for a more interactive and informative user experience. So each primary tag will spawn its childrens on click. If user unselects a primary tag, all its childrens should be unselected too. 

Implement a search or filter functionality to allow users to quickly find specific tags across all zones
Progress: Improved the core functionality of the tag selection and visualization system. The next session will focus on enhancing the TypeScript integration with D3.js and improving the user interaction with the force graph.
