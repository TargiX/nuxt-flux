# Session Update: 2024-03-20

## Development Steps

1. `/store/tagStore.ts`: Added hybrid tag functionality
   - Created HybridTag interface extending Tag
   - Added hybridTags Map to store state
   - Implemented createHybridTag action using Gemini API
   - Added removeHybridTag action
   - Enhanced prompt for better hybrid tag name generation

2. `/components/ForceGraph.vue`: Enhanced visualization with hybrid tags
   - Added selectedSecondaryTags tracking
   - Implemented hybrid tag creation on multiple selections
   - Added smooth transitions for hybrid tag creation/removal
   - Added visual styling for hybrid containers
   - Implemented proper cleanup of hybrid tags and child nodes
   - Fixed child tag selection state management

## Key Decisions

- Used opacity transitions instead of removing nodes to maintain graph stability
- Implemented 1-second delay before creating hybrid tags to allow multiple selections
- Positioned hybrid tags between their child nodes for intuitive visualization
- Enhanced Gemini API prompt to generate more meaningful hybrid tag names
- Used visual indicators (dashed borders, semi-transparent fill) for hybrid containers
- Maintained both store data and visual state synchronization

## Next Steps

0. Most important: Hybrid tags are magnifiying to parent tags more that others, but they should be less force in them. Also when se select 3rd tag, it should recreates that hybrid tag with combined concept of all 3 tags.

1. Next thing that we need to introduce concept of 3 level tags that will spread from that hybrid tags. 

2. Also tags creation process must be like an user plays with AI in game where AI must understand that user have in mind (like akinator game). User selects tags and AI must understand that user have in mind and create new tag with combined concept of all selected tags. And so on, so forth. Until user will be satisfied with the result.

2. Add type definitions for better TypeScript support
   - Create proper interfaces for D3.js
   - Add type declarations for Vue components
   - Define types for Heroicons
   - Create comprehensive Tag type definitions

2. Improve hybrid tag interactions
   - Add visual feedback when tags can be combined
   - Implement smoother transitions between states
   - Add hover states to show potential combinations

3. Handle edge cases
   - Maximum number of tags that can be combined
   - Conflict resolution for overlapping combinations
   - Error handling for failed hybrid tag generation

Progress: Successfully implemented core hybrid tag functionality with smooth transitions and proper state management. Next session will focus on improving TypeScript support and enhancing user interactions.
