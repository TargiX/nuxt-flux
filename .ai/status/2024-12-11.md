Session Update: 2024-03-12
Development Steps
store/tagStore.ts: Enhanced tag management system
Implemented zone-specific hybrid tag storage
Added improved LLM prompts for hybrid tag generation
Fixed link creation and management for hybrid nodes
Removed redundant selectedHybridTags state
Added proper cleanup for hybrid tags during zone switches
components/ForceGraph.vue: Enhanced visualization and interaction
Added prev/next zone navigation buttons with disabled states
Implemented multi-line text formatting for node labels
Fixed hybrid tag visualization and connections
Added constants for consistent sizing and spacing
Improved node positioning and force simulation
components/TagCloud.vue: UI and UX improvements
Added animated particle-based loading indicator
Enhanced dynamic tag generation with context-aware prompts
Added manual mode for prompt editing
Improved image generation handling
Fixed hybrid tag persistence in prompts across zones
Key Decisions
Moved hybrid tag storage to zoneGraphs to maintain state during zone transitions
Removed selectedHybridTags in favor of zone-specific storage to prevent duplication
Enhanced LLM prompts for both hybrid tags and dynamic tags to be more specific and meaningful
Chose particle-based animation for loading state to provide better visual feedback
Implemented proper tag state preservation when switching between zones
Next Steps
1. Enhance hybrid tag interaction
Add visual indicator for hybrid tag composition
Implement hover state to show component tags
Add animation for tag combination process
Improve error handling
Add fallback UI for failed LLM requests
Implement retry mechanism for failed requests
Add user feedback for errors
3. Enhance zone navigation
Add smooth transitions between zones
Implement keyboard shortcuts
Add zone thumbnails preview
Improve tag generation
Further refine LLM prompts for more relevant suggestions
Add user feedback for tag generation process
Implement tag categories or grouping
Progress: Successfully implemented core hybrid tag functionality with proper state management and improved UX. Next session will focus on enhancing the hybrid tag interaction and visual feedback.
