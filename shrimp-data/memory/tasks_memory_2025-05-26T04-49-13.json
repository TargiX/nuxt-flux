Key improvements include: 1) Reduced velocityDecay from 0.8 to 0.55 for better stabilization, 2) Removed simulation.stop() calls to preserve integration momentum, 3) Added light center force (0.02 strength) to prevent drift, 4) Optimized collision detection with better parameters (strength 0.6, iterations 1), 5) Implemented conditional velocity reset only for invalid nodes, 6) Created unified force factory functions for consistency, 7) Replaced deep JSON.stringify watch with version stamp approach, 8) Removed manual tick loop (50 iterations) that was causing blocking behavior, 9) Implemented ResizeObserver with requestAnimationFrame batching instead of window resize events, 10) Added proper cleanup in onBeforeUnmount to prevent memory leaks. These changes should provide 30-40% FPS improvement and 40% faster stabilization as predicted in the analysis.",
