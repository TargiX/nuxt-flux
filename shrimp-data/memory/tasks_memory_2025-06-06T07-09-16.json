      "summary": "The identified bug in `TagCloud.vue` was a single-line issue where an exposed `ref` from a child component was being accessed incorrectly. The linter error provided clear guidance, and the fix was to remove the `.value` from the expression `imageStripRef.value?.images?.value`. This correctly retrieves the image array, allowing it to be passed to the `ImageViewerModal`. The modal now receives the necessary props and should render the image and its details as expected. The fix is precise and directly addresses the root cause of the problem.",

      "summary": "The refactoring of `UserImageGallery.vue` is complete. The custom PrimeVue Dialog implementation has been successfully removed, along with all its associated state management, event handlers, and navigation logic (approximately 50 lines of script and 40 lines of template code). It has been replaced with a single line in the template: `<ImageViewerModal v-model=\\\"viewerVisible\\\" :images=\\\"images\\\" :start-index=\\\"viewerStartIndex\\\" />`. The script was simplified to only require two new `ref`s (`viewerVisible`, `viewerStartIndex`) and an updated `openImageModal` function. This change eliminates significant code duplication, centralizes the image viewing logic into the `ImageViewerModal` component, and ensures a consistent user experience across the application. The new implementation is cleaner, more maintainable, and directly follows the user's request.",
